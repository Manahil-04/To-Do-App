- Delete tasks.
- Persistent storage using browser's local storage.

## Technologies Used

2. **Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:**

3. **Start the Application**
    Run the application locally:

    The application will be accessible at http://localhost:5173 in your web browser. Note that the port number might vary if another service is already using port 3000.
